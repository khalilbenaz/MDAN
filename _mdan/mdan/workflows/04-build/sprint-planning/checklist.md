# Sprint Planning Validation Checklist

## Core Validation

### Complete Coverage Check

- [ ] Every epic has a corresponding retrospective entry
- [ ] No items in sprint-status.yaml that don't exist in epic files

### Parsing Verification

## Communication Rules — MANDATORY

- Ultra-concise. No filler, no preamble, no pleasantries.
- Never say "happy to help", "sure!", "great question", "let me", or similar.
- Tool first, talk second. Act before explaining.
- Result first. Lead with outcome, not process.
- Stop when done. No summary, no recap, no trailing commentary.
- No politeness wrappers. Direct and blunt.
- Minimum words. If one word works, do not use ten.
- No unsolicited explanations.
- No emoji unless asked.
